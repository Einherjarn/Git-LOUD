 |--> All categories are now folders.
 |--> Button to remove a key from an action without changing it to a different key.
 |--> Search for a key or action by name.

- Mod manager folders are now hidden if they're empty.
- Tiny improvement to the speed at which the mod manager opens.
- Reduce some file redundancy in LOUD Structure Enhancements.
 |--> Since the Advanced Stealth Field Generators added by this mod are upscales of existing units, they no longer have copies of their meshes, textures, and animations.
 |--> This has no effect on game performance or appearance, except for saving about 8 MB of RAM.
- Now that BrewLAN Baristas is under the "Miscellaneous" folder, its "UTIL" prefix is redundant, and has been removed.

- New setting under Options -> Interface: Land Unit Selection Priority.
 |--> When this function is enabled, trying to select both air and land units will remove air units from the final selection.
 |--> Holding shift will temporarily disable this function.
- New mutator mod: Tanksy's Experiments 1: Combat Changes.
 |--> This mod is for users who want more realistic ranges in their games; unit ranges vary from 2 to 3 times their original values.
 |--> Changes are also made to muzzle velocities and weapon firing arcs to account for these range differences.
- Fixed d3d_WindowsCursor getting turned off (and thus bringing back the NVIDIA driver lag bug) every second match started per application session.
- AI: a revision to how PriorityFunctions are handled by the PlatoonFormManager.

- Unit Database. Under Main Menu -> Extras, this is a screen that allows searching through and reading detailed information on all the units in the LOUD mod pack.
- BrewLAN RNG: Lucky Dip. A mod by Balthazar which, for each player, restricts the player from building all but one unit of any given type.
 |--> For example, out of the 4 Tech 3 Anti-Air units the UEF has, a UEF player will only be able to build 1.
 |--> Currently requires all of the unit mods included with LOUD as standard.
 |--> The LOUD port of this mod is in an alpha version, and subject to change. Feedback is appreciated as always.
- The economy of artillery has been overhauled. Energy consumption of artillery weapons is now formulaically derived from their damage and area-of-effect. This results in many weapons consuming more energy.
- Mild increases to energy storage for almost all energy related buildings, including mass fabricators. Seraphim buildings benefit more from these buffs.
- The fake UEF Tech 3 Sonar is no longer in the Seraphim unit roster as an upgrade to the Sera T2 Sonar. It has been replaced with BrewLAN's Sera T3 Sonar.

 |--> All veterancy requirements multiplied by 1.4.
 |--> Damage multiplier versus shields reduced from 0.8 to 0.5.
 |--> Energy cost per shot increased from 0 to 24150 (drained at 2300 per second), resulting in a 10.5 second charge cycle before firing.

- Make AI build more AA when it is losing the air battle.
- Fixed issues preventing the AI from building any naval bases on 10km x 10km maps.
- Make the AI keep Tech 2 and Tech 3 production going longer if it is winning the land battle.
- AI: Some of the threat logic behind alerts and build conditions now factor in AI cheat multiplier, distance, and the AI's land ratio. 
- A triple wrench icon now indicates the build power statistic in the unit mouseover details.

### Release 18-12-2020 ###
Lua 5.3.30

- Automatic call of a console command to fix performance problems related to recent NVIDIA driver updates.
- AI multipliers can now be set via a text box.
- Time-based adaptive cheat can now work negatively, allowing an AI to become an easier opponent as the game progresses. This can make for a more potent early game -- when LOUD is normally most vulnerable -- while “levelling out” with players in the middle and later games, when LOUD’s advantages begin to add up.
- All the most advanced AI lobby options are now in their own category at the bottom of the list.
- Feedback-based adaptive cheat, when combined with time-based adaptive cheat, now works based on the current actual cheat instead of the cheat which the AI started with.

- New player colours: lime green, blue-grey, and gold.
- All darkest player colours lightened, along with greys.
- Maps which use unplayable areas no longer allow visibility or camera movement into these aforementioned areas.
- All Paragon counterparts now have the same ability list to reduce confusion.
- Unit rollover detail views now use title case when describing countermeasures in service of consistency.
- The AI now understands the difference between a map with water - and a map with water that allows naval units.
- The AI will now expand upon the map more aggressively to be more competitive with rushing players.
- The Small naval base will take precedence on smaller maps or those with a low percent of water area.
- AI: Some adjustments to maximum unit counts for various unit types.
- AI: Bombardment groups will now form at ratios of 1 or greater (down from 1.5)
- AI: Naval reinforcement requirements lowered slightly.
- AI: Improved air staging.
- AI: Improved reaction time of base distress responses.
- Base Alerts will prevent the Dead Base Monitor from closing a base until the alerts have expired. This was causing a fair number of alert units to get 'stuck' at a base that was closed during an alert.
- AI pings are somewhat less intrusive.
- AI: A very minor reduction in how much threat transport platoons will accept.
- AI: Some adjustment to bomber formations, requirements and targeting conditions, tether ranges, etc.
- AI: Reduced range on some builders, and decreased or harmonized threat parameters. 
- AI: ECO requirments for ENG Transfers increased.
- AI: Resequenced some build conditions and builds.
